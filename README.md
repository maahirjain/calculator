# Calculator

A web calculator I built that supports parentheses, decimals, and follows the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).

The calculator has the following features:
- Accepts inputs up to 200 characters
- Allows the user to enter the computed answer back into the input expression by clicking it
- Includes both keyboard and button support
- Provides visual feedback for ambiguous or undefined computations
- Restricts the input of undefined expressions
- Supports parentheses, decimals, integers, and the basic arithmetic operators, and follows the order of operations
- Supports character deletion and clearing of the input
- Provides visual feedback for various interactions
- Responds to all kinds of devices
- Rounds answers to two decimal places
